**I once didn't know any JS**<p>
Then I took a class<p>
Then I got confused<p>
So I looked up function constructors and closures tutorials on YouTube<p>
Then I found Shiffman (sp?)<p>
Then I understood<p>

**functions, functions and more functions.** Objects and functions and variables and arrays. Then more functions inside functions, calling functions, making objects calling functions.

I would like to contribute to this awesome poem!
I was frastured with javascript because I didn't understand it
Then I found Shiffman on YouTube
Just like you!
